# intro_to_programming_final_project
This repository stores all files related to the Final Project for the Berklee Online course, "Introduction to Computer Programming for Musicians".

The name of this project is: "Fan Central Station".

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!

Fan Central Station will feature a search box for users to look up their favorite artists.

The search will reach out to several APIs to pull in various content about the artist.

From an outside-in level, an "artist fan page" might include the following::

* Random art from the "fan.art.tv" site
* Top 5 songs from the artist, pulled in from the "musixmatch" site
* A summary of the artist from "Lastfm"
* Most recent tweets about the artist from Twitter
* News about the artist (api TBD)
* Tour dates for the artist (from the "Ticketmaster" API)
* An optional signup sheet for users to be kept informed about their favorite artist

I am still trying to come up with a plan for an admin piece, but it would be tied to the signup sheet.
