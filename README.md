# intro_to_programming_final_project
This is the repository to store all files related to the Final Project for the Berklee Online course, "Introduction to Computer Programming for Musicians".

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!

This repo will create a "Fan Page" for any artist that a user might search for.

It will feature a search box for users to look up their favorite artists.

The resulting page will contain some cool stuff about that artist.
Several different APIs will be used to pull in various relating data.

From an outside-in level, an "artist fan page" might include the following::

* Random fan art from the "fan.art.tv" site
* Top 5 songs from the artist, pulled in from the "musixmatch" site
* News about the artist (api TBD)
* Tour dates for the artist (tailored to the user's location?)
* Could use the Google Maps API for directions to the concert venue

The admin piece is yet to be determined.
